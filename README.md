In order to understand git, we must first understand the basic functions and definitions of it.

Git Definitions

**GIT**--a form of supply chain management software and a distributed system that allows collaboration on code without the need for a network connection  

**GITHUB**—a web-based, GIT hosting service that provides access control and collaboration tools in a GUI interface 

**Repository**—a project’s “folder” where all project contents are held

**Clone**—does exactly that; creates a clone of the respective repository

**Commit**—code fixes that are pushed to the main when approved

**Push**—uploads local repo content to a remote repo 

**Pull**—fetches and downloads git content then immediately updates the local repo to math 

**Branch**—a “folder” that stores commits; organizational structure to point towards different commits

**Merge**—merges a user’s commit(s) to the respective branch

**Merge Conflict**—when a user’s commits or merge interfere with the current branch; usually caused by an outdated master branch

**Fetch**—same as pull but does not automatically update the local repo

**Remote**—allows changes to be pulled from a remote repo, branch, etc and immediately applies those changes to the respective branch

First and foremost, Git is how programmers share and collaborate on code and is integral in the work force for all things tech related. Being unfamiliar with Git says to your possible future employer that you do not care about the technological advancements over the course of the last two decades. 

Quick history. Git was created by Linus Torvalds to address one issue; all current source code management utilities required constant connection to a central computer to collaborate on code. Linus fixed this by allowing users to upload code that could be downloaded, worked on, then re-uploaded (but just that little snippet of code that was being worked on) to the same central computer with a detailed note of what/who changed AND could be reverted to any previous version starting at the first commit. Pretty cool huh? 

That sounds awesome! How can I start using it? Well, users can always use the command line version but that’s tedious to setup and manage for a novice. This is where GitHub comes into play. GitHub is a GUI interface that allows people to use Git in a more familiar and easier to understand environment. Want to pull a new repo? Fork it. What about commits and changing code? All done on one’s local repo (forked). How do I know someone isn’t messing with my code? Owners and approved collaborators can manually add and remove commits. Each commit also creates its own version history too. GitHub basically provides an easy to follow graphical interface that can be understood and used by novices and experienced users.  

Now how to start using GitHub to manage one’s Git repositories. 

1.)	Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/

2.) Find a project to controbute to at github.com/explore

3.)	Contribute to that project<br/> 
  a.	Fork the project by clicking “Fork” towards the top right-hand side of the repo page<br/> 
  b.	Make your contribution by creating a file, uploading a file, or editing code<br/> 
  c.	Under “Commit changes” at the bottom of the page, click “Commit directly to master branch.” Remember, this applies the changes to your local repo that was forked earlier<br/>
  d.	Pull the most current version of the master (original) branch<br/> 
  e.	Near the top of the page, click “Create new pull request”<br/>
  f.	If there are no possible merge conflicts, click “create pull request”. This will let the author(s) of the original repo know that someone has a possible fix for those devs to incorporate.<br/> 
  g.	You made a contribution!<br/>
  4.)	If the maintainers of that project agree that the fix is feasible, they will push it to their source code.
